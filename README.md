# `hhi` An R Package Calculating the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)

I am in the process of writing a new `R` package aimed at straightforward and quick calculation of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), which is a measure of market concentration used in studies of competition in a variety of fields including, business, economics, political science, finance, etc. The package will include a variety of complementary computational and diagnostic functions. Please see the working `R` script and check back for more on this release. I anticipate submission to CRAN shortly.
